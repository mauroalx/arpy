# Arpy (Arp ran in Python)

## What is Arpy?

Arpy is a simple and powerful tool designed to locate IP addresses on a local network. The idea for this software arose from the need to find DWDM Management IPs (Huawei) where Panel\SCC is not available, and for digital radios like SIAE, Comba, Ceragon, or any other devices where the network analyst has lost IP information.

You can locate a host within a /16 network in a few seconds (or minutes if you're not lucky).

## How to use?

To start using Arpy, set the network in the subnet field. However, you must first configure your interface on the same network on your Windows system, or you can go to the `Config` menu and set it directly there (requires running as an administrator).
